Greek architectural examples are temples, theatres, and stadiums. Later on during the reign of the Roman Empire, there would be a period called the Hellenistic period where architects drew heavy inspiration from Greek culture. This period would forever etch Greek architecture into the world from the Renaissance to the modern day.

They also had overhanging ceramic tiles as their roof which protected the building from getting wet easily as wood rots faster when exposed to water.

This style of architecture uses pointed arches, elaborate stained glass mosaics, and ornaments such as gargoyles. One famous example would be the Cologne Cathedral in Germany which has been in construction for many centuries, having been completed in the 1900s.

Victorian homes were usually quite tall to look imposing, typically 2-3 stories at least. they also had complicated shapes to break away from the static Greek revival style. These structures could include a large porch with ornaments and the homes were painted in bright, vibrant colors.

After being colonized by the Spanish, we moved to the "Antillian" architecture which was adapted into a Filipino style. We had "Bahay-na-Bato" or stone houses which is a blend of Filipino and  Spanish architecture. The Spanish also influenced the construction of churches in the Philippines, like the San Agustin church. When the Americans came, they brought over Steel and concrete, turning the Philippines into a neoclassical-esque style.
